            <h2>Wlee Cat</h2>
            <p class="penulis">ditulis oleh <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yaizaa.n/profilecard/?igsh=bmxxN3ZyZDFvbnE2">yaizaananda</a> pada pukul 23:39 WIB, 4 november 2024</p>
            <p>There once was an eepy cat named Pablo who had perfected the art of snoozing. Every time he fell asleep, his tiny pink tongue would slip out and dangle like a little flag, as if to signal his surrender to the land of dreams. Pablo wasn’t just a sleepy cat, he was a professional eepy. He’d curl up in the silliest positions, his paw sometimes resting right on his face, tongue still sticking out, looking like he was deep in thought...or just deep in eep. Neighbors would peer through the window, cooing, “Look at that silly eepy cat with his lil’ tongue out!” And Pablo, of course, just dreamed on, blissfully unaware of all the attention his tongue was getting, he is probably tired due to all the sleep-wake up-eating-sleep cycle that he does daily, what a poor cat</p>

             <h2>Waterfall cat</h2>
            <p> There was an orange cat named Oyen, famous for being the eepiest kitty in town. Oyen didn’t just fall asleep, she dropped into a nap like she’d been working hard all day, even if all she’d done was stare at absolutely nothing. And when Oyen was deep in her sleep, the most amazing thing happened: a tiny stream of drool would start trickling from her mouth. It was as if Oyen’s dreams were so juicy that they just had to spill out! She’d lie there, tongue peeking out, a puddle forming beneath her chin, while everyone around whispered, “Look at that little eepy orange fountain!” Oyen, of course, snoozed on, adding to her puddle of bliss, one drop at a time. The kitty is sleeping so hard that his mouth is currently challenging the famous Niagara Waterfall to be the largest waterfall in the world</p>

             <h2>Mug Cat</h2>
             <p>Once upon a snooze, there was a very eepy, very smol, and very round cat named Bean. Bean had a unique talent for finding odd places to nap, and her latest obsession was a big, oversized mug on the kitchen counter. She’d somehow wedge her pudgy little paws inside the mug, curling up so her jellybean toes poked out just above the rim. Her humans would look over and see Bean’s plump body spilling over the sides, feet tucked in like she was steeping in her own cozy cup of tea. As Bean snoozed, she’d give little twitchy kicks, as if dreaming of chasing tiny marshmallows. And there she’d stay, snug and eepy, a perfectly brewed cup of Cat. The mug is now her house, i heard from my friend that this cat is recently trying to adapt to a snail's lifestyle, the cat said she do that because its eco-friendly</p>

            <h2>Round Cat</h2>
            <p>There was a kitten named Pudding who was, without a doubt, the roundest, eepiest little fluffball ever to grace a nap. Pudding didn’t look like a kitten so much as a perfectly rotund ball of fur with tiny ears and an itty-bitty nose poking out. When Pudding decided it was time to sleep, she’d just plop down wherever she happened to be—no stretching out, just a sudden and complete surrender to the nap. Curled up like a dumpling, she’d make little snuffling noises, her paws tucked in so tight they disappeared in her fluff. Her humans would gather around, whispering, “Is it a kitten? Is it a meatball?” But Pudding was too far gone, floating through her dreamland of yarn and snacks, eepy as can be in her little ball form. Why is bro so round i cant even explain anymore, but he is cute tho</p>

            <h2>Alien Cat</h2>
            <p>WATCH OUTTT EVERYONE!!!, an alien invasion is coming!, find the nearby shelter ASAP, prepare your food stocks, get all the powerfull weapon supplies, but don't worry the alien cat is eepy, anyways, Far away from our galaxy, on the planet Mew, lived a bright green alien cat named Blep, An inter-galactic Avengers level humanity threat who was the eepiest space kitty in the galaxy. With fur as neon as a glow stick and cheeks so chubby they wobbled when she walked, Blep was known throughout the cosmos for her impressive snoozing skills. She’d plop down anywhere—asteroid fields, spaceship seats, or random space rocks—and fall into a deep, eepy sleep with her round cheeks squished against whatever surface she found. Sometimes, her silly alien ears would flicker with tiny sparks, as if she were dreaming of cosmic tuna. Astronauts would pass by, scratching her heads and snapping photos of the silly, snoozing green furball with cheeks that looked like they were stuffed with treats. Blep, of course, would just blep in her sleep, totally unaware that she was the cutest thing this side of the universe.</p>
